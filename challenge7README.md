# Challenge 7: README Generator

## Description

This project is a **README.md file generator** built using Node.js. It enables developers to quickly create professional and structured README files for their repositories by answering a series of prompts.

The application uses `Inquirer.js` to collect input from the user and dynamically generates a `README.md` file based on the responses. The generated README includes sections for the project's description, installation, usage, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and licensing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Input:** Prompts for essential project details like title, description, installation steps, and more.
- **License Badge:** Generates an appropriate license badge and section based on user selection.
- **Structured Output:** Automatically formats the README file with headings, sections, and table of contents.
- **Ease of Use:** CLI-based application that simplifies README creation.
